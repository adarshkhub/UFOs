# UFOs
a foray into javascript

## Overview
In this project we build a dynamic webpage that can accept user inputs and filter a table of information accordingly.
UFO sightings information can be filtered based on multiple different search critera (event date, city, state, country and shape). 

## Results

The initial page, displays all the data in the table:
![index page 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67844710/195493669-aeb419ae-e740-4cb6-854d-775ea93a9206.png)

Users can then search for specific sighting information by entering input in the table, by date for example:
![filter by date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67844710/195493697-941f2c4f-e992-425f-b87c-e62f308db879.png)

Or by city:

## Summary

A fun resource for ufo enthusiasts. However one drawback to the site is that the search function doesn't catch partial searches. For example, in order to find information about fairfield you would have to type the whole word instead of just fair or field. The site can definitely be further developed by adding links to detailed pages about specific ufo events. Also one functionality of the site, refreshing the table by clicking the UFO sighting button at the top of the page isn't very intuitive, this can definitely be improve either stylistically to indicate a button or by adding a specific refresh button under the searches.
